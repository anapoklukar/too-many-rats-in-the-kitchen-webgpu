## Objects

We used a combination of custom 3D models and assets from the **[KayKit: Restaurant Bits](1https://kaylousberg.itch.io/restaurant-bits)** pack. Models were optimized with UV maps and reduced texture sizes to improve game performance. The chef and rats were simple models (see figures below) with the rats having different states: alive, made into wine, cooked or burnt.

## Game Time

The game simulates a single day in the restaurant, lasting about **3 minutes**. Guests wait approximately **40 seconds** for their meals, and each dish takes about **5 seconds** to prepare (without any rat-induced delays).

## Music and Sound

The game features **["George Street Shuffle"](https://incompetech.com/music/royalty-free/index.html?isrc=USUAN1300035)** by Kevin MacLeod as background music, creating a prestigious restaurant ambiance. [Sound effects](https://freesound.org) include beeping for the stove, blender mixing, frying sounds, cash register chimes for completed orders, a bell for new orders, and clicking in the UI. All audio is sourced from CC0 or Creative Commons Zero licenses.

## Gameplay

Players control the head chef using WASD for movement and spacebar to interact with objects. The goal is to prepare and serve dishes quickly while managing a rat infestation in the kitchen. Players can kill rats, fry them, prepare wine, deliver meals, and discard failed dishes. Successful orders earn money and increase the score. The game lasts three minutes, challenging players to balance cooking and rat control efficiently.
